# SmartMedKit

## Problem Identification
The need for immediate, accurate medical guidance and efficient management of first-aid supplies in emergencies is crucial. Traditional first-aid solutions lack the integration of smart technology, leading to missed opportunities for timely and informed assistance.

## Solution Overview
SmartMedKit is an innovative IoT-enabled first-aid kit equipped with real-time tracking and AI-based analysis features. It provides instant medical advice through a user-friendly web application, revolutionizing the way first-aid assistance is administered.
